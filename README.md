## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where I can find data-log for CRON?

CRON update data-log is stored in the `var/log/` folder of Magento store. Newsletter subscribers synchronization log is saved in `smly_customer_cron.log` file and Abandoned Cart log is stored in `smly_cart_cron.log`.

### How can I filter RSS-feed output by category and limit results?

You can access RSS feed by visiting ulr `store_url/smaily/rss/feed` and you can add parameters (category and limit) by appending them to URL separated with slashes. For example `store_url/smaily/rss/feed/category/bikes/limit/10`. Regular RSS-feed shows 50 last products.

### How can I access additional Abandoned cart parameters in Smaily template editor?

Here is a list of all the parameters available in Smaily email templating engine:

- Customer first name: `{{ first_name }}`;
- Customer last name: `{{ last_name }}`;
- Store view: `{{ store }}`;
- Store group: `{{ store_group }}`;
- Website: `{{ store_website }}`.
- Is abandoned cart: `{{ is_abandoned_cart }}`;

Up to 10 products can be received in Smaily templating engine. You can refrence each product with number 1-10 behind parameter name:

- Product name: `{{ product_name_[1-10] }}`;

- Product description: `{{ product_description_[1-10] }}`;

- Product image URL: `{{ product_image_url_[1-10] }}`;

- Product SKU: `{{ product_sku_[1-10] }}`;

- Product quantity: `{{ product_quantity_[1-10] }}`;

- Product price: `{{ product_price_[1-10] }}`;

Product price is the end price that the customer sees in the cart. If you have a special price set for the product, it will be shown here. This price also includes taxes and discounts.

- Product base price: `{{ product_base_price_[1-10] }}`.

Product base price is the price that is set in the product edit page. This price also includes taxes but no discounts.

Also you can determine if customer had more than 10 items in cart:

- More than 10 items: `{{ over_10_products }}`.

## Troubleshooting

### Regular export fails to run

Usually a good place to start would be to check Magento CRON's Schedule Ahead for value. We have found that value of 60 works the best, if you are running daily exports.
