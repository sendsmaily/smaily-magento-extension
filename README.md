# Smaily for Magento 2

## Description

Smaily email marketing and automation extension module for Magento.

Automatically synchronize newsletter subscribers to a Smaily subscribers list, generate RSS-feed based on products for easy template import and send new newsletter subscribers directly to Smaily.

NOTE! One of the most noticeable shortcoming of the extension is that it allows only one-way synchronization, i.e. subscribers can only be exported from Magento to Smaily. It will be addressed in the next major version, after Smaily has added the capability for data export through the API.

## Features

### Magento Newsletter Subscribers

- Add subscribers to Smaily subscribers list
- Magento built in subscribe newsletter form sends subscribers directly to smaily
- Magento built-in CAPTCHA and google reCAPTCHA support

### Magento Products RSS-feed

- Generate default RSS-feed with 50 latest products for easy import to Smaily template
- Option to customize generated RSS-feed based on products categories
- Option to limit generated RSS-feed products amount with prefered value

### Two-way synchronization between Smaily and Magento

- Get unsubscribers from Smaily unsubscribed list
- Collect new user data for subscribed users
- Generate data log for each update

### Abandoned cart notification

- Automatically notify customers about their abandoned cart
- Send abandoned cart information to Smaily for easy use on templates

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where I can find data-log for Cron?

Cron update data-log is stored in the `root/var/log/` folder of Magento store. Contacts synchronization log is saved in "smly_customer_cron.log" file and Abandoned Cart log is stored in "smly_cart_cron.log".

### How can I filter RSS-feed output by category and limit results?

You can access RSS feed by visiting ulr `store_url/smaily/rss/feed` and you can add parameters (category and limit) by appending them to url separated with slashes. For example `store_url/smaily/rss/feed/category/bikes/limit/10`. Regular RSS-feed shows 50 last products.

### How can I access additional Abandoned cart parameters in Smaily template editor?

Here is a list of all the parameters available in Smaily email templating engine:

- Customer first name: `{{ first_name }}`.
- Customer last name: `{{ last_name }}`

Up to 10 products can be received in Smaily templating engine. You can refrence each product with number 1-10 behind parameter name.

- Product name: `{{ product_name_[1-10] }}`.

- Product description: `{{ product_description_[1-10] }}`.

- Product SKU: `{{ product_sku_[1-10] }}`.

- Product quantity: `{{ product_quantity_[1-10] }}`.

- Product price: `{{ product_price_[1-10] }}`.

- Product base price: `{{ product_base_price_[1-10] }}`.

Also you can determine if customer had more than 10 items in cart

- More than 10 items: `{{ over_10_products }}`.

## Troubleshooting

### Regular export fails to run

Usually a good place to start would be to check Magento CRON's Schedule Ahead for value. We have found that value of 60 works the best, if you are running daily exports.
